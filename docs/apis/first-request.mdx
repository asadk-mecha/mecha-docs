# Make Your First Request

This tutorial will walk you through making your first request to the Mecha API. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to send a request and receive a response, setting you on your way to integrating with the Mecha system.

- **Generating an API Key**
    - Prerequisites
        1. Sign Up to [Mecha Console](https://console.sandbox-v1.mecha.build/auth/signup)
    - Steps to generate an API key
        1. From [Mecha Console](https://console.sandbox-v1.mecha.build/settings/api-keys), go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
        2. Select **Generate key,** add key name, select expiry and description
            
            <img src={newApiKeyaUrl} alt="CAPTCHA" />;
            
        
        1. Make sure to copy and save your personal access token(i.e. Key Secret) , as you will not be able to see it again.
        The key secret is **only shown once**. Do not store the secret in plaintext where others can access it. Anyone with this token can perform the authorized actions against the resources that the token has access to.
            
            <img src={copyKeyUrl} alt="CAPTCHA" />;
            
- **Making Authenticated Requests**
    - How to use the API key in HTTP requests?
        
        **In the HTTP Headers :**
        
        This is a secure and common method where the API key is included in the request headers.
        
    - Sample request
        1. Curl Request:
        
        <img src={curlRequestUrl} alt="Curl Request" />
        
        2. Bruno example
            
        <img src={apiKeyBrunoUrl} alt="API Key Bruno Sample Request" />
            

Congratulations on making your first request to the Mecha API! Now that you’re familiar with the process, you can start exploring other API endpoints to build powerful integrations with Mecha.
