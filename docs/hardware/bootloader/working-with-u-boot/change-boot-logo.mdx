# Customizing the Boot Splash Image

Customizing the boot splash image on your OS can give it a personal touch. This guide will walk you through the process of locating the default splash image, replacing it with your custom image, and ensuring that the changes are applied when you reboot.

## Step 1: Locate the Default Splash Image

The default splash images used by Plymouth are typically located in `/boot/splash/logo.bmp`. This file controls the appearance of the U-Boot logo.

**Note**: The resolution must be 480x480 pixels.

## Step 2: Replace the Default Image

### 1. Prepare Your Custom Image

- Create or choose an image you want to use as the boot logo.
- Ensure the image is in BMP format and has a resolution of 480x480 pixels.

### 2. Backup the Original Image

Before replacing the image, back up the original one:

```bash
sudo cp /boot/splash/logo.bmp /boot/splash/logo.bmp.bak
```

### 3. Replace the Image

Copy your custom image over the default one:

```bash
sudo cp /path/to/your/logo.bmp /boot/splash/logo.bmp
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily replace the default OS boot splash image with your custom logo. Backing up the original image ensures that you can revert to the default logo if needed. Your custom image will be displayed during the boot process, giving your system a personalized touch.
