# Variables Required for U-Boot

To build U-Boot for the Mecha device, you need to have these variables set on your machine:

```bash
ARCH = "arm64"
CROSS_COMPILE = "/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-"
```

These variables are required to build arm64-based U-Boot for our target Mecha platform.

## How to Use Variables in Linux

### 1. Introduction to Variables in Linux

In Linux, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated within scripts or the command line. They are crucial for tasks such as storing user inputs, file paths, or configuration options.

### 2. Types of Variables

- **Environment Variables**: System-wide variables that affect the behavior of processes. Examples include `PATH`, `HOME`, and `USER`.
- **Shell Variables**: Variables that are specific to the shell session and can include environment variables or user-defined variables.
- **Local Variables**: Variables that are specific to a script or a function within a script.

### 3. Creating and Using Variables

#### a. Defining a Variable

To create a variable in the shell, simply assign a value to a name without any spaces around the `=` sign.

```bash
variable_name="value"
```

For example:

```bash
greeting="Hello, World!"
```

#### b. Accessing a Variable

To access the value of a variable, prefix the variable name with `$`.

```bash
echo $greeting
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

#### c. Exporting a Variable

If you want a variable to be available to child processes, you need to export it:

```bash
export variable_name
```

For example:

```bash
export greeting="Hello, World!"
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Environment variables are typically defined in shell initialization files like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.

#### a. Common Environment Variables

- `PATH`: Specifies directories to search for executable files.

```bash
echo $PATH
```

- `HOME`: User's home directory.

```bash
echo $HOME
```

- `USER`: Current logged-in username.

```bash
echo $USER
```

#### b. Setting Environment Variables

To set an environment variable:

```bash
export VAR_NAME="value"
```

For example:

```bash
export EDITOR="vim"
```

This sets `vim` as the default editor.

### 5. Command Substitution

You can assign the output of a command to a variable using command substitution:

```bash
current_date=$(date)
echo $current_date
```

### 6. Unsetting Variables

If you need to remove a variable, you can use the `unset` command:

```bash
unset variable_name
```

For example:

```bash
unset greeting
```

### 7. Working with Arrays

Bash also supports arrays, which can hold multiple values:

```bash
my_array=("value1" "value2" "value3")
```

Access elements by index:

```bash
echo ${my_array[0]}
```

### 8. Advanced Tips

#### a. Read-Only Variables

You can create a read-only variable using the `readonly` command:

```bash
readonly pi=3.14
```

#### b. String Operations

You can manipulate strings stored in variables using various operators:

- Length of a string:

```bash
echo ${#greeting}
```

- Substring extraction:

```bash
echo ${greeting:0:5}
```

#### c. Default Values

You can assign default values to variables if they are not set:

```bash
echo ${greeting:-"Default Greeting"}
```

### 9. Examples

#### a. Simple Script with Variables

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="John Doe"
greeting="Hello, $name"
echo $greeting
```

#### b. Script Using Environment Variables

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "User: $USER"
echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
```

### 10. Persistent Variables

To make variables persistent across sessions, add them to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` for Bash):

```bash
echo 'export MY_VAR="my value"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
