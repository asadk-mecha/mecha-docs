This guide will help you connect to your Comet-M device using PuTTY on Windows, both via SSH and the debug console (UART).

## Installation

* Download and install PuTTY from the [official PuTTY download page](https://www.putty.org/).
* After installation, open the PuTTY application.

## Connecting via SSH

1. In the 'Host Name (or IP address)' field, enter `mecha-comet-m.local` (default) or the IP address/hostname of your device.
2. Ensure that the **'SSH'** option is selected under 'Connection type'.
3. (Optional) To save this session for future use:
   - Type a name under 'Saved Sessions'
   - Click 'Save'
4. Click **'Open'** to start the SSH session.
5. If this is your first time connecting, you'll see a security alert. Click 'Yes' to accept it.
6. Enter your username and password when prompted.

Default credentials for Comet-M:
```
username: mecha
password: mecha
```

You are now connected to your server via SSH using PuTTY!

## Connecting to the Debug Console via UART

1. Connect your Comet-M to your computer using a UART cable. Follow [this guide](https://www.notion.so/Connecting-via-Serial-Console-7127aa108fce4a18bb7440c9bd8f9cda?pvs=21).
2. Open **Device Manager** on your Windows machine.
3. Expand the "Ports (COM & LPT)" list.
4. Note the COM number for the device named 'USB Serial Port'.
5. Open PuTTY and select the '**Serial**' option under '**Connection type**'.
6. Enter the COM number in the 'Serial line' field.
7. Set the speed (baud rate) to **115200**.
8. Click 'Open' to start the session.

If set up correctly, a new window will open where you can interact with your device via the UART connection.
