Mecha-Agent is an open-source tool designed to manage and monitor Mecha Machines. It provides a range of services to ensure efficient operation and communication within the Mecha ecosystem.

## Services

- **Provisioning:** Configuring and setting up Mecha Machines for operation within the network, including initial setup and configurations.
- **Messaging:** Facilitating secure communication between Mecha Machines and other components, supporting multiple messaging protocols and real-time data transmission.
- **Machine Status:** Monitoring the health and operational status of Mecha Machines, providing alerts for critical issues.
- **Settings:** Configuring various operational parameters of the Mecha Agent, including network configurations, logging options, and custom settings.
- **Networking:** Managing connectivity aspects of Mecha Machines, supporting different network protocols, and handling dynamic network environments.
- **Telemetry:** Collecting and transmitting performance data from Mecha Machines to monitor system health, optimize performance, and analyze machine operations.

## Set up Mecha Agent

- **Docker:** Deploy the Mecha Agent using Docker containers for a consistent and isolated environment, enabling easy scaling and management across different systems.
- **Linux:** Install and configure the Mecha Agent on Linux-based operating systems. Ensure compatibility with various distributions and make use of native system tools for deployment.
- **macOS:** Set up the Mecha Agent on macOS environments. Utilize system-specific commands and configurations to ensure smooth operation on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.
- **Windows:** Install and run the Mecha Agent on Windows operating systems, using available installation packages and compatible tools for seamless integration.
- **Kubernetes:** Deploy the Mecha Agent within a Kubernetes cluster for automated orchestration, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Building from source:** Compile the Mecha Agent directly from the source code, allowing for custom modifications and optimizations suited to specific deployment requirements.

## Create Configuration File

Files in the format of `yml` are supported. When starting Mecha Agent, you specify the path to the settings file via the `-- -s` flag. The `settings.yml` file is used to manage the configuration of Mecha Agent. Here is an example of what the file might look like:

```yaml
# settings.yml

version: 1.0
logging:
  enabled: true
  path: /var/log/mecha-agent.log
  level: DEBUG
server:
  url: 0.0.0.0
  port: 3001
  tls: false
messaging:
  system:
    enabled: true
    url: nats://nats:4222
  user:
    enabled: true
    url: nats://nats-machine:4222
  service_urls:
    base_url: 
    get_nonce: /v1/messaging/get_nonce
    issue_auth_token: /v1/messaging/issue_token
settings:
  storage:
    type: file
    path: ~/.mecha/agent/db
status:
  time_interval_sec: 60
networking:
  enabled: true
  disco_addr: 0.0.0.0:8080
  wireguard:
    tun: wg0
    port: 51820
    userspace: linux
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  collect:
    system: true
    user: true
```
## Environmental Variables
Environmental variables take precedence over config file values. Nested paths get mapped to config values by putting an underscore `__` (double underscore) between every level, so `messaging.service_urls.get_nonce` becomes `MECHA_AGENT_MESSAGING__SERVICE_URLS__GET_NONCE=<value>`.

## Start Agent

```
# to build 
cargo build 

# to run 
sudo cargo run -- -s "./settings.yml"

# env to set settings file path
MECHA_AGENT_SETTINGS_PATH # default ~/.mecha/agent/settings.yml
```
