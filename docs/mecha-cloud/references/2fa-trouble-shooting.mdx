# 2FA Troubleshooting & Support

## Troubleshooting 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) Issues

If you're having trouble with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your Mecha account, follow these steps to resolve common issues:

### 1. Ensure Your Authenticator App is Set Up Correctly

- **Check the Time on Your Device**: Make sure the time on your device (phone or tablet) is set correctly. 2FA codes are time-sensitive, so an incorrect time can cause issues.
- **Sync Your Authenticator App**: Some authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator) have an option to sync the time within the app. Use this feature if your codes aren’t working.

### 2. Unable to Receive 2FA Codes

- **Check Your Internet Connection**: Ensure that your device is connected to the internet, as some apps may require a connection to update codes.
- **Reinstall the Authenticator App**: If you're still not receiving codes, try uninstalling and reinstalling your authenticator app. After reinstalling, set up 2FA again with Mecha.

### 3. Lost Access to Your Authenticator Device

- **Use Backup Codes**: If you've lost access to your device, use one of the backup codes you saved when setting up 2FA. If you don't have backup codes, you will need to contact Mecha Support to regain access.
- **Contact Support**: If you cannot use backup codes, reach out to Mecha Support with your account details for further assistance.

### 4. 2FA Codes Not Being Accepted

- **Try a Different Code**: Sometimes, codes may expire quickly. Generate a new code and enter it immediately.
- **Recheck Time Settings**: Ensure your device's time settings are correct, and try entering a code again.

### 5. Disabling 2FA Temporarily

- **Access Your Account**: If you can still access your Mecha account, go to **Settings > Account** and disable 2FA temporarily.
- **Reset 2FA**: After disabling, you can re-enable 2FA to reset the connection and resolve any issues.

### 6. Contacting Support

- **If all else fails**: Contact Mecha Support with detailed information about the issue, including any error messages you’ve received. They can guide you through advanced troubleshooting or reset your 2FA settings.
