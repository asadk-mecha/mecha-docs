#### 9. Enter Your Credentials: 
Use the email (or username) and password you registered with to sign in.
#### 10. Access Your Dashboard: 
After logging in, you'll be taken to your console dashboard, where you can start using Mecha.

### Option 2: Sign up with Github

For a quicker registration process, you can sign up using your GitHub account.

#### 1. Click the GitHub Button: 
On the signup page, look for the "Sign in with GitHub" button.
#### 2. Authorize Access: 
You will be redirected to a new page, asking you to authorize Mecha to access your GitHub account.
   If you are not logged into GitHub, you will be first required to do so

   Else it will directly ask you to Authorize Mecha

#### 3. Complete the Signup: 
Once authorized, your GitHub account will be linked to Mecha, and you'll be signed in automatically.
   * **Note**: If you prefer to sign up using email instead of GitHub, proceed to the next step.

### Troubleshooting Tips

* **Captcha Issues**: 
If you get stuck at the **Captcha** check, try refreshing the page or using a different browser.
* **Email Verification**: 
If you don't receive the verification email, check your spam folder or request a new one via 'Resend link' button.

That's it! You've successfully created and verified your account on Mecha. You're now ready to explore Mecha Console.
