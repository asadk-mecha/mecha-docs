### Step 3: Set Encryption Method

#### 1. **Choose an Encryption Method:**
   * **Managed by Mecha:**
      * The encryption key is automatically generated and securely stored in an encrypted key store managed by Mecha.
   * **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):**
      * You have the option to provide your own encryption key. This key is **not** stored in Mecha's storage.
      * **Enter or Generate a Key:** Specify an encryption key of 32 characters or generate one using the provided tool.
      * **Note:** You will need to re-enter this key every time you add a new node to this network.

   * Your new network will be created, and you will be automatically redirected to its details page.

You've successfully added a new network to your Mecha Console. This network is now ready to be utilized by your devices and applications.
