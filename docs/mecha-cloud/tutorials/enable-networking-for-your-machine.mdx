There are two ways to start the process of adding a machine to a network:

1. **Via Machine Listing:**
   * Locate the machine in the listing and click **'Enable'** under the IP address section of the machine you want to configure.
2. **Via Machine Details:**
   * Go to **Settings > Networking** within the machine details page and click **'Enable'** to start the process.

### Step 2: Configure Network Settings

Once you initiate the process, a new modal will appear for configuring the network settings:

1. **Choose Network:**
   * Select the network you want to add the machine to from the dropdown list.
2. **Specify IPv4 Subnet Address:**
   * You can either accept the suggested address, generate a new one by clicking on the icon, or enter a custom IPv4 address.
3. **Enter the DNS Name:**
   * You can choose the suggested DNS name or specify one of your own.

After entering all the required information, click **Save** to apply the settings.
