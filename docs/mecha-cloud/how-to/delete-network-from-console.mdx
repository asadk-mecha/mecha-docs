# Delete Network From Console

Follow these steps to delete a network in your management console:

## Step 1: Access the Networking Section

- **Login to your Console**: Start by logging into your console.
- **Navigate to Networking**: Click on the "Networking" tab at the top of the console.

## Step 2: Select the Network to Delete

- **Locate the Network**: In the "Networks" section, you will see a list of networks.
- **Open Network Options**: Find the network you want to delete and click on the three vertical dots (â‹®) next to it.

## Step 3: Initiate the Deletion Process

- **Select "Delete"**: In the dropdown menu that appears, click on "Delete".
- **Review the Warning**: A warning message will pop up, notifying you that deleting the network will remove all existing data associated with it.

## Step 4: Confirm the Deletion

- **Enter Network Name**: To confirm the deletion, you need to type in the exact name of the network in the provided text field.
- **Confirm Delete**: Once the name is entered, click on the "Confirm Delete" button to finalize the process.

## Step 5: Success Notification

## Important Notes:

- **Default Network**: If the network is set as the default, you might want to set a new default network before deleting.

This completes the process of deleting a network in your console.
