            **Copying files to your Mecha Comet**
            Run the below command, replacing the `/path/to/src` with your file and the `<ip address>` ([here](./find-ip-address)) - to send the file to your Mecha Comet's destination directory.

            ```bash
            $ scp /path/to/src mecha@<ip address>:/path/to/dest

            # Example
            $ scp ~/Documents/myfile.txt mecha@<ip address>:/home/mecha
            ```

### Copying multiple files
To copy multiple files, list the file names in a single command, separated by spaces:

```bash
# Sending
$ scp file1.txt file2.txt mecha@<ip address>:/path/to/dest

# Receiving
$ scp mecha@<ip address>:{/path/to/src/1,/path/to/src/2} .
```

### Copy files matching a pattern
Use a wildcard to copy all files matching a particular filter. The following command copies all files that end with .txt:

```bash
$ scp *.txt mecha@<ip address>:/path/to/dest
```

### Copying an entire folder (recursively)
To copy a folder and all of its contents, pass the folder name with the `-r` (recursive) flag:

```bash
$ scp -r /path/to/folder mecha@<ip address>:/path/to/dest
```
