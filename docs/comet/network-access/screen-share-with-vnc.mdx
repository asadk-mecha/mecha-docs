Access your Mecha Comet's desktop remotely via the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) protocol using `wayvnc`. Follow the instructions below for setting up VNC connection between your Mecha Comet and your computer.

## Setting up VNC Server

<S>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
           Connect to your Mecha Comet using SSH ([here](./find-ip-address)).

           ```bash
           $ ssh mecha@<ip address>
           ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
           Run the following command to install `wayvnc`.
                
            ```bash
            $ sudo apt update
            $ sudo apt install wayvnc
            ```

            WayVNC is a VNC server for wlroots-based Wayland compositors, in our case we are currently using [labwc](https://github.com/labwc/labwc) as the compositor.

    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
            Run `wayvnc`, this will start a VNC server on the port 5900 listening on all interfaces.
    
            ```bash
            $ export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1
            $ wayvnc 0.0.0.0 5900
            ```

            Setting `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` in the environments tells any Wayland client launched from the shell, which compositor to connect to.

            :::warning[Security Risk]
                Binding to the 0.0.0.0 interface exposes VNC on all your network interfaces creating a security risk, better approach is to bind to your network's assigned IP address or use 127.0.0.1 and using Tunneling via SSH for secure access.

           Install the `TigerVNC` client to connect to your Mecha Comet.

            ```bash
            $ sudo apt update
            $ sudo apt tigervnc-viewer
            ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
            Once the installation is complete, you can start the TigerVNC viewer by running the command below

            ```bash
            $ vncviewer
            ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
            In the VNC viewer, enter your Comet's IP address ([here](./find-ip-address)) and the VNC Server's port number (`5900`) and press `Connect`. After that, you should be connected to your VNC server running on the Comet.
