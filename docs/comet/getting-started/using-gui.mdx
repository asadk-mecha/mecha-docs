The Mecha Comet out-of-the-box runs **Mechanix OS**, a Debian-based Linux distro that we are developing for the Comet (or any other small-screen touch devices).

### Home Screen

The Comet's homescreen displays info such as wireless status, battery, bluetooth and system stats (CPU, memory, uptime) for easy monitoring. The pinned apps quickly lead to respective apps. You may swipe down from the top for quick settings, or swipe up for the app drawer.

The Home button on the side lets you return to the homescreen instantly.
