title: Building Debian Rootfs with Mecha Make
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

Mecha Make is designed to simplify and modularize the process of building a customized Debian-based Linux distribution for the **Mecha Comet** device. Written in Nushell, Mecha Make uses a series of modules that cover all aspects of system configuration and package installation, enabling you to:

- Configure network settings, audio, Bluetooth, and more.
- Manage package sources and installations both on the host and target systems.
- Automate the entire build process, from setting up a base system with debootstrap to finalizing the root filesystem packaging.

## Prerequisites

### Host System Requirements

1. Debian-based Linux system (recommended)
2. Nushell
    
    Install the latest version of [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell). 
    
3. Install required tools:
    
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install -y \
      debootstrap \
      qemu-user-static \
      wget \
      dpkg
    
    ```
    

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mecha-org/mecha-make.git
cd mecha-make

```

### 2. Customize Configuration

### Key Configuration Files to Modify

- `conf/build.yml`: Core system settings
    - Change hostname
    - Set timezone
    - Configure user details
    - Modify package sources
- `conf-packages/target.yml`: Package selection
    - Add or remove package groups
    - Customize installed packages

### Example Customization

```yaml
# In conf/build.yml
hostname: my-custom-machine
user:
  name: myuser
  password: mypassword

# In conf-packages/target.yml
# To add a package group
package_groups:
  - name: development
    packages:
      - git
      - build-essential

```

### 3. Build the System

```bash
nu build-debian.nu mecha-comet-m-gen1 /path/to/build/directory

```

This process will generate final rootfs bundle that you can flash to your **Mecha comet** device.

## Customization Tips

### Package Management

- Add packages by editing `conf-packages/target.yml`
- Create new package groups for specific use cases
- Remove unnecessary packages to reduce image size

### System Configuration

- Modify `build.yml` to:
    - Change keyboard layout
    - Set locale
    - Configure SSH settings
    - Adjust OS release information

### Troubleshooting

- Check build logs for any installation issues
- Ensure `qemu-user-static` is installed
- Validate YAML configuration files

## Quick Modifications Checklist

1. ✅ Change hostname
2. ✅ Set user credentials
3. ✅ Configure network sources
4. ✅ Select desired packages
5. ✅ Customize system locale
6. ✅ Set up SSH preferences

## Warning

- Always backup your configuration files
- Test configurations in a controlled environment
- Verify package compatibility
