**USB Mass Storage (UMS)** mode is a feature that allows a device to function like an external USB storage device when connected to a host computer.

In UMS mode, the device’s internal storage, such as eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard), is made accessible to the host computer, similar to how you would connect a USB drive or SD card to your host machine.

This mode is useful for tasks like transferring files, flashing firmware, or writing disk images to the device’s storage.

Now, here are the steps for booting into UMS mode from either internal eMMC storage or SD card:


## **Booting into UMS Mode from Internal eMMC Storage**

1. Connect the Mecha comet device to a host machine using a USB male to male cable.
2. Connect the Serial to TTL converter (FTDI) to your Mecha comet and to the host machine.
3. Open the serial monitor application on your host machine.
4. Power on the Mecha comet device.
5. Quickly press Any key  to enter the U-Boot console.
6. From U-Boot console type `ums 1 mmc <dev number>`, where is the device number for MMC card.

After completing these steps, your Mecha Comet device should be visible as a USB storage device on your host machine.
