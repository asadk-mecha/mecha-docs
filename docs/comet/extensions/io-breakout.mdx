## Overview
The IO Breakout device is equipped with **40 pogo pins**, allowing seamless connection to various extensions such as GPIOs, gamepads, and keyboards. To make these GPIO pins breadboard-friendly, the **GPIO Extension** is utilized.

## GPIO Extension Features
1. **Breadboard-Friendly Interface**  
   The GPIO Extension converts the 40 pogo pins into **2.54mm pitch female headers**, making it easier to connect using jumper wires for prototyping and experimentation.

2. **USB-to-UART Conversion**  
   The GPIO Extension includes a **CP2102 USB-to-UART converter chip**, which facilitates the conversion of USB signals into UART signals, streamlining communication with your host system. to connect with your host system there is type C port on GPIO Extension.
