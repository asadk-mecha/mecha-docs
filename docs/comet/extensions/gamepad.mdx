## USB Connectivity via 40-Pin GPIO
The 40 pogo pin on comet device includes USB pins as well, allowing for seamless integration with Human Interface Devices (HID), such as gamepads. This feature simplifies connectivity and enhances user experience when attaching peripheral devices.

The Comet Extension Gamepad is powered by the versatile **RP2040 microcontroller**, which provides a robust USB interface supporting both host and device modes. This makes it especially convenient for use with HID peripherals.

## Firmware Options
- The gamepad operates with an Arduino-based firmware. You can access the firmware file [here](https://web-assets.mecha.so/developers-v1/comet/extensions/gamepad-arduino-firmware.rar).
- Alternatively, you can flash your own custom firmware, whether it's written in **Arduino** or **Python**, to meet your specific requirements.
