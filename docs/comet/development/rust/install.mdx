Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes performance, reliability, and productivity. It provides memory safety without garbage collection and supports concurrent programming without data races. Rust is particularly well-suited for developing system tools, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

## Install rust using rustup

Rustup is the official installer and version management tool for Rust. To install `rustup` run the below command.

```bash
# Download and run the rustup installer script
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Load Rust environment variables into current shell session
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

After installation, verify that Rust is properly installed

```bash
$ rustc --version
$ cargo --version
```

## Running an example

Let's create a simple Hello World program to test the installation:


<S>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
            Create a new directory, and a new source file for your rust program.

            ```bash
            $ mkdir hello_rust && cd hello_rust
            $ nano main.rs
            ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
            Paste the following program in the editor

            ```rust
            fn main() {
                println!("Hello, Rust!");
            }
            ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
           Now lets compile and run the program.

            ```bash
            $ rustc main.rs
            $ ./main 
            Hello, Rust!
            ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
</S>

You are now ready to run our favorite crustacean compiler ðŸ¦€!
